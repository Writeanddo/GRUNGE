CONTENT TO ADD:

// Change medal unlock sound (maaaybe)
// Add seb slimed dialog + sprites + medal
// Victory screen + "ENDLESS MODE UNLOCKED" text
// Add KG Stumps
- Accurate level preview videos
- Full SFX pass



BUGS:

For the future:
~ Resume button might be worth adding, seen multiple people pause and press a button instead of pressing escape again
~ If you select ENDLESS and select the boss stage, I think it should have, in VHS letters in the center "INSERT TAPE" as opposed to the rest of the levels which are showcased appropiately
- Have health flash when meter is low, maybe
- Add URLs to credits names in-game
- Alt frames for greenhead
~ Need to add some delay between getting hit by bullets or extend the existing i-frames time, can get bodied by scion slimes if you stand next to them

Game breaking:
// Endless mode doesn't unlock after beating boss

Ahnock:
// Title screen needs aspect ratio controller, going fullscreen fucks things up (hopefully also fixes web build page zooming)
// If you have enough goo left over you might be able to blow up first charge guy in tutorial, check to make sure you can't shoot during that bit
// Add glint effect to potion
// Extend weapon timers to 20 seconds instead of 15
//? Scum skulls can drop weapon powerups - not good because they can replace scythe
//? Occasionally holding right mouse to charge enemy does nothing, and releasing just chucks it (TIED TO RELOAD TIME SOMEHOW)
//? Bullets sometimes phase through boss 2 hitbox, might need to make it slightly smaller
//? Dropped boogernaut armor should despawn after a while
//? Boss phase 2 can send you FLYING if you die and then it bumps your corpse
//? Thrown enemies that land on boss phase 1 can spawn powerups on it

Jack:
// 11:00 or so: Maybe add one fewer big guy
//? Stunned should only slow to 75%
// 15:45, some guy didn't get thrown
- Boss phase 2 needs improved intro animation
//? Spawn fewer big guys in phase 1, make phase 2 more difficult (WIP)

Diency:
//? Pressing X after beating tutorial or any time in tutorial doesn't unlock level 1
// Charged and thrown enemies need to do circlecast before exploding, if you're already touching a wall they just ignore it (instead just added self destruct after 0.5 sec)
//? Unlocked level 2 medal just by pausing (should be fixed)
// Extend weapon box animations so the glint only shows once every few cycles
// Powerups should be more noticable when they spawn, particle effects / fanfare would help
// Powerups would make more sense to be dropped by enemies and not at the same 3 points
// Reduce shotgun bullet spread
MORE FEEDBACK ON VIDEO, CHECK LATER

Kled:
// Sebacian should make a remark about throwing the dummy in his direction instead of the wall , maybe recolor sprite to
// Make short music loop for when slick + seb are in car after tutorial
// something feels off about grabbing and throwing (Add slight delay before charge begins and decrease time it takes to reach full charge, also increase shake sound volume)
// Cut off intro to Everglades music so it plays in time with the wall explosion
// Enemies just spawning in front of the door took me a bit out of the experience, having them fade in might help
// Make it so Chaste doesn't say his name, come off as more mysterious
// Slick's response to Chaste about The way I see it we did a better job thing, I feel like he should sound more smug and cocky about this
// Carrying a nose goblin to the top right cabin wall makes them clip out of bounds
~ Can also chuck nose goblins out of level if you stand in top right corner, might need to adjust hitbox

Fruits:
//? New levels aren't selected by default in level selector when level is beat
// Endless mode could allow for raised max enemy amount
//? Gun pickup needs much larger hitbox, very difficult to pick up the first time

Jub:
~ Scythe throw could have more of an impact, maybe add particles when it hits (also change from ontriggerenter to circlecast with some delay between each cast)

Dougle:
//? Make gap on right side of lawn fence larger

Shrombus:
// Edit basement to be an O shape and not a C shape
- Make house approach door play animation just like one inside house
