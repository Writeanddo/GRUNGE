BUGS:

Game breaking:
- Endless mode doesn't unlock after beating boss

Jack:
- Tutorial boom sfx doesn't play on level completion
- Maybe add arrow indicator for powerups
- 11:00 or so: Maybe add one fewer big guy
- Stunned should only slow to 75%
// 15:45, some guy didn't get thrown
- Add sound for totem hover
- Boss phase 2 needs animation
- Spawn fewer big guys in phase 1, make phase 2 more difficult

Kled:
- Add beeping sound when selecting a stage since it's like a TV changing channels
- Sebacian should make a remark about throwing the dummy in his direction instead of the wall , maybe recolor sprite to
- Make short music loop for when slick + seb are in car after tutorial
- If you select ENDLESS and select the boss stage, I think it should have, in VHS letters in the center "INSERT TAPE" as opposed to the rest of the levels which are showcased appropiately
- something feels off about grabbing and throwing (Add slight delay before charge begins and decrease time it takes to reach full charge, also increase shake sound volume)
- Cut off intro to Everglades music so it plays in time with the wall explosion
- Enemies just spawning in front of the door took me a bit out of the experience, having them fade in might help
- Make it so Chaste doesn't say his name, come off as more mysterious
- Slick's response to Chaste about The way I see it we did a better job thing, I feel like he should sound more smug and cocky about this
// Carrying a nose goblin to the top right cabin wall makes them clip out of bounds
- Can also chuck nose goblins out of level if you stand in top right corner, might need to adjust hitbox

Fruits:
- New levels aren't selected by default in level selector when level is beat
- Endless mode could allow for raised max enemy amount
- Gun pickup needs much larger hitbox, very difficult to pick up the first time

Jub:
- Scythe throw could have more of an impact, maybe add particles when it hits (also change from ontriggerenter to circlecast with some delay between each cast)

Dougle:
- Make gap on right side of lawn fence larger

Shrombus:
- Edit basement to be an O shape and not a C shape
