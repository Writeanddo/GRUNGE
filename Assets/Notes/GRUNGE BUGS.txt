GRUNGE BUGS + FIXES

Goo drops and goo splats get stuck in walls regularly
Should have sound play when hand shoots out
Objects (vase, saw, etc) should play sound when they hit a wall or shatter
Other sfx to add:
- Enemy firing bullets
- Enemy spawning(?)
- Level transitions
- play the game and find out

Make goo regen over time (slowly)
Improve scion slime bullet patterns

IDEAS 

-Goo potions bust open into goo drops
//Fence door is attached, throw trash can / prop at it to break it
-Maybe a couple frames after an 
-Enemy shield damages shouldn't reset if you throw an enemy and regrab it 
-If you use an enemy to block its own bullet some interesting shit happens (larger AoE damage etc.)
