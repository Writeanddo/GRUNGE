GRUNGE BUGS + FIXES

- Should have sound play when hand shoots out
- Objects (vase, saw, etc) should play sound when they hit a wall or shatter
Other sfx to add:
- Enemy firing bullets
- Enemy spawning(?)
- Level transitions
- Tutorial boom sfx doesn't play on level completion
- Add sound for totem hover
- Change powerup ping sound
- Add beeping sound when selecting a stage since it's like a TV changing channels
- play the game and find out

// = problem solved
//? = problem solved in theory, untested
~ = problem abandoned / not worth solving


//? If projectiles overlap with an enemy the frame they spawn, they don't explode (frustrating)
  // This also applies to hand grabbing
  - Also applies to walls (what?)

- Maybe make final enemy explode after a while if its held, sometimes I forget I'm holding it

01:20
//? Threw skinny at fence in first area. skinny phased through fence at specific angle.
04:05
~Hands look weird when flinging towards boxes and barrels on third floor

10;08
// Charge spitter immediately after realizing that the charges were hitting me, throwing it caused it to propel really weirdly in a different direction entirely, before walking into a wall and exploding
17:08 
//? Goofy ass motherfucker doesn't even care anymore (neither do I apparently as I continued to grab him and charge him without testing around with him at all)
18:05
//? I throw an object at the wall and it causes me to bounce off of it
18:15
//? Rocket sprite (as well as possibly other gun variants, not that I've seen any appear on this floor so far) projectile fires under the candle


- Can't pause during most of tutorial



//? Boss 2 car cutscene should move player and boss upwards so they aren't visible on the car, should also cancel any boss animations
// Play splat sound when adjusting SFX for volume reference
- Add more dialog to post-tutorial cutscene
~ Stop music or fade out music and return ambience once front lawn level is beaten
//? Scythe should be able to destroy props and stop bullets
// Add auto self destruct to scum skulls, they might not actually get killed by killtriggers
// Make dumbass enemies lerp towards vector2.zero always

//? Zooming in / out on webpage fucks with scaling
//? Camera lerp at end of level snaps to player right at very end, could stand to be smoother
//? Hide crosshair at end of basement
//? Make it so dialog only appears outside of endless mode
//? Need to destroy powerups when boss phase 1 ends
//? Boss phase 2 can apply knockback when you're dead, cancelling your death animation
//? Skulls on ground should have larger hitboxes for when you step on them, larger ones should explode when stepped on maybe
//? Make weapon crates grabbable (easy) (ESPECIALLY SCYTHE PICKUP)
//? Make sure pause is disabled by default at start of every level
//? Try and reset preview video when "START" is pressed so static shows as soon as you see the level select screen
//? Basement goo door still appears above scion slime shadows
//? Weapon boxes need rigidbodies, grabbable depends on them
//? Can advance text while paused
//? Hide and show crosshair during cutscenes
//? Every once in a while the releasedRightMouse trigger doesn't go off (and sometimes you can't stop charging? weird shit)
//? Boogernaut drops should despawn after time, can get a lot of them in an area in endless mode
//? Send overall kills to scoreboard

// Add car door open sprites
// White screen left side needs to be extended for final boss arena
// Add explosion when slick busts out of cabin and when cabin explodes
// Remove any goo gibs when boss 2 dies so we don't hear player pick them up off screen
// Make boss 2 patterns play in order so you can frequently get skulls
// Hide crosshair during dialog
// Make it so slightly fewer scion slimes appear in endless
// Nose Goblin managed to stay alive during phase 1 transition (need to make manager also destroy spawn animations)
// Nose Goblins sometimes get stuck on boss platform when thrown
// Update most recently selected level when exiting level
// Make fully charged enemies spawn way more goo gibs (Currently 3x)
// Wood gibs on boogernaut wall explode need to be replaced with gibfragments
// Can't quit or press menu buttons in tutorial, something's covering them
// Add achievement popup
// If your shield goes down to 1 WHILE YOU'RE CHARGING it can explode in your hand
// Scythe projectile sorting layer may be incorrect
// Make music play after door explodes if in endless mode
// Crate the scythe leans on can be blown up (shouldn't do that)
// Grabbing a new powerup while holding the scythe makes scythe sprite persist
// Remove all sources of directional audio, WebGL build doesn't like it one bit
// TIMER PROBABLY CONTINUES IF PAUSED
// Bounceback on grabbles hitting objects can send player flying if they collide
// Can throw enemies through skinny walls
// Gatling Goobers sometimes refuse to notice player - Occured at top left of workbench, throwable props were involved
// Have tutorial continue to level 1 rather than boot you to title screen
// Door doesn't appear on cabin before enemies spawn
// Boogernaut laser impact spawns incorrectly sometimes
// Scythe should appear semi-infrequently
// SCYTHE SPAWNS OUTSIDE OF ENDLESS MODE (and currently not at all)
// FREAK OCCURANCE maybe: Threw fully charged guy and he didn't explode when hitting a wall (maybe an auto self-destruct is in order)
// Carrying a nose goblin to the top right cabin wall makes them clip out of bounds
// Add ambience to beginning of cabin level
// Maybe make basement level only begin once you step on the pentagram
// Hide crosshair in front lawn cutscene
// Level 1 didn't play car animation (freak occurance?)
// Scythe lasts indefinitely
// Had a hard time triggering front lawn level end for some reason, maybe make collider bigger
// Make sound cues for heal ready and powerup spawn louder
// Scythe charge sound is incorrect
// Can't grab objects after scythe expires
// Tutorial shovel doesn't self destruct
// Can't fire rocket while charging enemy
// Continue showing static on level select screen until video player is ready
// Wall exploders are broken on endless mode since wave is chosen randomly
// Maybe make music fade at end of each level with sound effect, hotline miami style
// Porch has collision issues, can't damage enemies when you fling them into it
// Scion Slimes get stuck leaving kitchen left
// Gibs can STILL SPAWN IN WALLS if hit at the right angle (something to do with tilemap collider maybe?)
// Shield icon needs to follow player when not centered
// Issues with scion slime shadows when hit
// Goo drops and goo splats get stuck in walls regularly
// Multiple powerups can spawn on same point
// Stump appears over and under enemies
// Make enemies see thru porch
// Make goo regen over time (slowly)


~ Make text pixel-perfect
~ Music doesn't loop seamlessly in webgl build
~ Crosshair is jittery when player / camera moves - Would need to make crosshair a UI element - bit of a pain in the ass, so do it later
~ Improve scion slime bullet patterns
~ Make boss intro cutscene skippable
~ FREAK OCCURANCE where enemy spawned all goo gibs in a massive diagonal line along a wall
~ Check if user is logged in and advise login at game start

IDEAS 

-Enemy shield damages shouldn't reset if you throw an enemy and regrab it 
-If you use an enemy to block its own bullet some interesting shit happens (larger AoE damage etc.)


FINAL CHECKS BEFORE PUBLISHING
