GRUNGE BUGS + FIXES

- Should have sound play when hand shoots out
- Objects (vase, saw, etc) should play sound when they hit a wall or shatter
Other sfx to add:
- Enemy firing bullets
- Enemy spawning(?)
- Level transitions
- play the game and find out

// = problem solved
//? = problem solved in theory, untested
~ = problem abandoned / not worth solving


- If projectiles overlap with an enemy the frame they spawn, they don't explode (frustrating)
  // This also applies to hand grabbing
  - Also applies to walls

- Maybe make final enemy explode after a while if its held, sometimes I forget I'm holding it

Threw skinny at fence in first area. skinny phased through fence at specific angle.
01:49 
// Threw fatty at toilet corner, looks weird
03:08
//? Threw skinny at wall in kitchen, power of grunge toast caused it to phase through wall at specific angle
04:05
~Hands look weird when flinging towards boxes and barrels on third floor
04:23
// Player phases under wall on top of 3rd floor

10;08
Charge spitter immediately after realizing that the charges were hitting me, throwing it caused it to propel really weirdly in a different direction entirely, before walking into a wall and exploding
17:08 
Goofy ass motherfucker doesn't even care anymore (neither do I apparently as I continued to grab him and charge him without testing around with him at all)
18:05
I throw an object at the wall and it causes me to bounce off of it
18:15
Rocket sprite (as well as possibly other gun variants, not that I've seen any appear on this floor so far) projectile fires under the candle


- Make weapon crates grabbable (easy)
- Can advance text while paused
- Can't fire rocket while charging enemy
- Every once in a while the releasedRightMouse trigger doesn't go off (and sometimes you can't stop charging? weird shit)
- Add car door open sprites
- Play splat sound when adjusting SFX for volume reference
- Add ambience to beginning of cabin level
- Maybe make basement level only begin once you step on the pentagram
- Hide and show crosshair during cutscenes
- Make boss intro cutscene skippable


//? Bounceback on grabbles hitting objects can send player flying if they collide
//? Can throw enemies through skinny walls
//? Gatling Goobers sometimes refuse to notice player - Occured at top left of workbench, throwable props were involved
// Maybe make music fade at end of each level with sound effect, hotline miami style
// Porch has collision issues, can't damage enemies when you fling them into it
// Scion Slimes get stuck leaving kitchen left
// Gibs can STILL SPAWN IN WALLS if hit at the right angle (something to do with tilemap collider maybe?)
// Shield icon needs to follow player when not centered
// Issues with scion slime shadows when hit
// Goo drops and goo splats get stuck in walls regularly
// Multiple powerups can spawn on same point
// Stump appears over and under enemies
// Make enemies see thru porch
// Make goo regen over time (slowly)


~ Make text pixel-perfect
~ Music doesn't loop seamlessly in webgl build
~ Crosshair is jittery when player / camera moves - Would need to make crosshair a UI element - bit of a pain in the ass, so do it later
~ Improve scion slime bullet patterns

IDEAS 

-Enemy shield damages shouldn't reset if you throw an enemy and regrab it 
-If you use an enemy to block its own bullet some interesting shit happens (larger AoE damage etc.)
