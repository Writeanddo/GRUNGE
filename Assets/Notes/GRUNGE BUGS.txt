GRUNGE BUGS + FIXES

- Should have sound play when hand shoots out
- Objects (vase, saw, etc) should play sound when they hit a wall or shatter
Other sfx to add:
- Enemy firing bullets
- Enemy spawning(?)
- Level transitions
- play the game and find out

- Gatling Goobers sometimes refuse to notice player
  - Occured at top left of workbench, throwable props were involved

- If projectiles overlap with an enemy the frame they spawn, they don't explode (frustrating)
  - This also applies to hand grabbing

- Make text pixel-perfect
- Bounceback on grabbles hitting objects can send player flying if they collide
- Music doesn't loop seamlessly in webgl build
- Crosshair is jittery when player / camera moves
  - Would need to make crosshair a UI element - bit of a pain in the ass, so do it later
- Improve scion slime bullet patterns
- Shield icon needs to follow player when not centered
- Issues with scion slime shadows when hit

- Maybe make final enemy explode after a while if its held, sometimes I forget I'm holding it

//? Porch has collision issues, can't damage enemies when you fling them into it
//? Can throw enemies through skinny walls
//? Scion Slimes get stuck leaving kitchen left
// Goo drops and goo splats get stuck in walls regularly
// Multiple powerups can spawn on same point
// Stump appears over and under enemies
// Make enemies see thru porch
// Make goo regen over time (slowly)


IDEAS 

-Enemy shield damages shouldn't reset if you throw an enemy and regrab it 
-If you use an enemy to block its own bullet some interesting shit happens (larger AoE damage etc.)
